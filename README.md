# CS320-Software-Testing-Automation-and-Quality-Assurance

For CS320, we were directed to create various classes for a mobile app, then test the classes using JUnit tests. Assignments for each week generally focused on another set of features to add, as well as the related JUnit tests to make sure features were working as expected. In this repo, I'm adding the Contact, ContactService, ContactTest, and ContactServiceTest classes which were part of the overall final project. I've also added the overall project summary here, which reviews the general requirements, how I went about testing, and the mindset I tried to adopt during the class. Below is a summary of how I go about creating software, as required in the course's Module Eight Journal assignment.

-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
 The primary way to ensure this is by performing thorough testing. This includes both making sure test coverage is adequate (the percentage of which likely depends on the project) and that output matches expected results.   
    
-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Generally, I begin by seeing what the user expects the program to do, then try to break down their requirements into a list of individual components that need to be created. These are then implemented one-by-one into the program until all requirements are met.
    
-How do I approach designing software?
I've generally approached designing software by starting with the requirements, and then building the software in iterations, adding features individually, then testing, then adding additional features. While adding new features, I also generally try to perform some sort of regression testing to make sure previously added features still act as expected. Once all desired features have been added, I will test the overall program for actual output vs. expected output.
